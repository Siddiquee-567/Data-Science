This project analyzes the Black Friday sales data to predict customer purchases.
It uses a dataset containing information about customer demographics, purchase history, and prod-
uct details.
Machine learning algorithms are applied to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
The project aims to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase on Black Friday.
The insights gained can help retailers optimize their marketing strategies and improve sales.





This project predicts Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using decision trees.
It uses the Iris dataset, containing 150 samples with 4 features (sepal/petal length/width).
A decision tree classifier is trained on the data to learn patterns and relationships.
The trained model is then used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
The project evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
